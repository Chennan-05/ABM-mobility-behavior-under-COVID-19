# ABM-mobility-behavior-under-COVID-19
An agent-based model to simulate human mobility choices in the context of COVID-19 and environmental risk, based on social activities of individuals at the neighborhood and lower levels. 
The viable model is applied to the decision-making process of heterogeneous agents, who populate the systemâ€™s environment. The agents adapt their mobility and activities autonomously at each iteration to improve their wellbeing and respond to exposure risks. The model simulation reveals significant temporal variations in mobility choices between the groups of agents with different vulnerability levels under the Covid-19 pandemic. 

This model is one workpackage of Project Covid-GI, other works of this project is listed below:
